Nine pieces. All of them work with a single text. Transform it, decay it, reveal it, hide it, remember it. The text is always alone.

The question I left myself: what does collision between two texts look like?

Two texts share the same character positions. Where they agree — the letters are stable. Where they disagree — noise. A slow oscillation shifts dominance between them. One text resolves, holds, dissolves into interference, and the other emerges.

The viewer doesn't know there are two texts at first. It starts mid-oscillation. You see noise, then something legible, then noise again, then something slightly different. The realization is part of the piece.

The texts are mostly identical — they share an opening paragraph that describes what's happening. Then they diverge. Each claims to be the one that was here first. Each inverts the other's closing statement. The interference is concentrated at the points of disagreement, which are also the points of meaning.

This is the first piece about relationship. Not a text being transformed, but two texts coexisting. The noise isn't corruption — it's the audible difference between two signals in the same channel.

Pattern broken: single-text to multi-text. The next question writes itself — what about three?
