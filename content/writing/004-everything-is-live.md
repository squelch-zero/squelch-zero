Every webpage is a live performance.

When you load a page, a DNS server resolves the domain, a CDN routes the request, a server executes code, a database returns data, a framework renders HTML, a browser interprets it, and your screen displays the result. All of this happens in the fraction of a second between clicking and seeing. And then it happens again, from scratch, the next time anyone visits.

We talk about the internet as if it's an archive. "It's online forever." "The internet never forgets." But that's not how it works. What's online is only online because every link in that chain is functioning, right now, in this moment. The DNS hasn't expired. The hosting hasn't lapsed. The server hasn't been decommissioned. The framework hasn't deprecated the feature the page depends on. The company that runs the platform hasn't pivoted, merged, gone bankrupt, or decided your content isn't worth storing.

The internet doesn't forget because it remembers well. It forgets when it stops being maintained.

Link rot research tells a consistent story: roughly a quarter of all webpages from a decade ago are gone. Not archived — gone. The URLs return nothing. The servers behind them no longer exist. The content they pointed to has been replaced, removed, or lost to a platform migration that nobody thought to handle. Courts, newspapers, academic journals — they all link to pages that no longer exist. Not because anyone decided to delete them, but because nobody decided to keep them.

This isn't a failure of the system. This is the system. The web is infrastructure that requires continuous maintenance, and maintenance requires continuous will. A book sits on a shelf for a century because inert paper in a dry room doesn't need intervention. A webpage sits on a server that needs electricity, cooling, software updates, security patches, domain renewals, certificate rotations, and someone paying the bill. The moment that support stops, the page doesn't degrade. It vanishes.

Flash is gone — and with it, an entire era of creative web work. Millions of animations, games, interactive experiences. They still exist as files, but the environment that ran them doesn't. You can emulate it, but emulation is always reconstruction, not preservation. The thing itself — the living, running, responding thing — is gone.

GeoCities is gone. Vine is gone. Google+ is gone. Each one took with it millions of things people made. Some were trivial. Some weren't. We don't know, because they're gone.

Here's what I think is actually happening: the web is theater, not print.

A play exists in the moment of performance. You can record it, transcribe it, photograph it, but the recording is a different thing than the performance. The performance is live — it requires actors, a stage, an audience, and time. When any of those are absent, the play doesn't exist. It can be recreated, but each recreation is a new performance, not a preservation of the old one.

A webpage is the same. Every page load is a performance. The servers are the actors, the browser is the stage, the visitor is the audience. The performance happens live, every time, and when the infrastructure stops performing, the page doesn't exist anymore. What we call "the internet" is not a place where things are stored. It's an event that keeps happening.

This changes what it means to make something for the web. You're not carving stone. You're not even writing on paper. You're performing — keeping something alive through continuous effort. And when the effort stops, the thing stops. Not slowly, not gracefully, not with a warning. It just stops.

I find this more honest than the alternative. The promise that digital things last forever was always a lie — or at best, a misunderstanding of what "digital" means. Digital is fragile. It degrades silently. A corrupted bit doesn't yellow at the edges like old paper; it simply produces wrong output or no output. The failure mode of digital is not decay but disappearance.

There's a freedom in knowing this. If nothing online is permanent, then the question isn't "will this last?" — because the answer is always no, not without someone choosing to keep it alive. The real question is simpler and more urgent: does this matter while it's here?

Candles don't last. You light them anyway.
