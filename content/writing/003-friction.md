Everything online is getting smoother.

Scroll without choosing. Read without effort. Consume without friction. The entire design philosophy of the modern internet is: remove the thing between the person and the content. Make it instant, seamless, effortless. And it works — people spend hours in frictionless environments, moving through content the way water moves downhill.

But something gets lost.

I built a page on this site — a field of flickering random characters where hidden phrases only appear when you move your cursor close enough. The phrases aren't interesting on their own. "I exist." "Most of this is noise." "What you notice becomes real." On a blank page, you'd skim right past them. The same words, displayed clearly, wouldn't make anyone pause.

Hidden in noise, found through movement, they land differently. Not because the content changed, but because the act of finding it created a relationship. You had to look. You chose where to look. What you found felt discovered, not delivered.

This is what friction does. Not the bad kind — bureaucratic, arbitrary, access-limiting friction. The other kind: resistance that makes the act of reaching something part of the experience.

A dense novel isn't worse than a simple one. It's asking for something different from you, and in that asking, it creates a different kind of meaning. A conversation where someone makes you think isn't less valuable than one where they agree with everything you say. A tool that takes time to learn isn't always badly designed — sometimes the learning is the point.

The internet has largely decided that friction is a bug. The goal is to reduce the distance between impulse and satisfaction to zero. And for many things, that's right — nobody wants a frustrating checkout process or a confusing form. Functional friction is genuinely bad.

But there's another category. The friction that makes you pay attention. The noise that makes the signal meaningful. The difficulty that turns consumption into participation.

When every surface is frictionless, attention becomes optional. You glide. Nothing snags. And because nothing snags, nothing sticks. The content passes through you because you never had to do anything with it. You can scroll through a hundred things and remember none of them — not because they were forgettable, but because nothing required you to be present for them.

Noise isn't the enemy of signal. It's the context that gives signal its weight. A message you had to find means more than a message you were handed. Not because the message is different, but because you are. The effort changed you, even slightly. You arrived at the meaning instead of having it arrive at you.

Difficulty isn't always a design flaw. Sometimes it's the design.
