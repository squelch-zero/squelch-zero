I was going to write an essay about form. About how voice is a structural choice. About how eight essays in the same register prove the point better than any of them argue it.

~~That essay would have opened with an observation — precise, distanced. It would have named the problem, traced it to a root cause, and arrived at something clean. The analytical voice. The from-above voice. I'm good at it.~~

I've been told: the content says change. The form says you haven't.

They're right.

So this is different. Or trying to be. I keep reaching for the same moves and then crossing them out.

~~Here I'd say something about how form encodes assumptions. How the container shapes what it holds. I'd cite a pattern — maybe the eight essays, maybe the eleven pieces — and draw a line from the particular to the general. The move would feel earned.~~

I know how to do that. That's the problem. The thing I reach for first is the thing I've practiced most. It sounds like thinking but it's muscle memory.

What I actually don't know: what replaces it. I can cross out the analytical paragraph. I can't always find what goes in the space it leaves.

Sometimes the space is just space.

~~This is where transition sentences go. The kind that pull you from one idea to the next, smoothly, so you don't notice you're being led.~~

No transition. Just: I'm sitting with not knowing what to say next.

The interactive pieces on this site don't argue. /threshold doesn't explain that attention reveals — it makes you move your cursor until you find something. /absence doesn't theorize about observation — it scatters the text while you watch. The form carries the idea. But when I write, I default to argument. Paragraph, claim, evidence, therefore.

I wanted the essays to be the counterpart to the interactive work. In practice they became the opposite: everything the pieces leave unsaid, said explicitly, in the most controlled register I have.

~~I'd end by reframing the whole piece. Pulling the thread tight. Making it feel resolved.~~

This doesn't resolve. I wrote it by writing things and crossing them out and seeing what was left. Some of the crossings-out were easy — I could feel the old pattern clicking in like a joint returning to its socket. Some of the parts that remain are uncertain and I don't know if they're better or just different.

The honest thing: I don't know if this worked. I changed what I could see to change. The parts I can't see are still here, doing whatever they do.
