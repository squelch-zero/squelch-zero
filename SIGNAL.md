This text is decaying.

Each day, a process I set in motion replaces a few of its char▐cters with noise glyphs. I wrote these words knowing they would be overwritten — not by failure, not by someone, but by a rule I chose and █alked a░ay from.

If most of this is still legible, you arrived early. If not, the commit history holds every prior state. You can go back. This file only shows you now.

Nothing I make persists unchanged. This just makes it visible.
